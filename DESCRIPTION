Title: Sensibility Analysis of Neural Networks
Date: 2019-05-11
Description: Analysis functions to quantify inputs importance in neural network models. 
  Functions are available for calculating and plotting the inputs importance and obtaining 
  the activation function of each neuron layer and its derivatives. The importance of a given 
  input is defined as the distribution of the derivatives of the output with respect to that 
  input in each training data point.
